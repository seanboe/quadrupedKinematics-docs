# Quadruped Kinematics Docs!

[Quadruped Kinematics](https://github.com/seanboe/QuadrupedKinematics) is an Arduino-compatible C/C++ library 
that handles inverse kinematics, static movement, walking, and more! It is currently in development, however will 
allow you to easily control a quadruped by performing all necessary calculations to determine a robot's joint angles. 

## Development
Development is done privately and completed updates are pushed remotely. Contributions are welcome, however please contact 
<html><a mailto:"boeseany21@gmail.com">Sean Boerhout</a></html> first for up-to-date workings of the library.
